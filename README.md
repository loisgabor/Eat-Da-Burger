## Usage

![gif homework](./public/assets/demo.gif)
Insert a burger name in the input section and click add the burger. The added burger will then go directly the the burger section. Next to the newly added burger, there will be a "devour it" button where you can click and immediately the burger will redirect to the Eaten burger section. If the list gets too long, feel free to delete the eaten burgers!
